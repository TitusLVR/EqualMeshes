# :hammer: Equal Meshes
Equal meshes is a Blender addon intended to provide useful tools when dealing with sets of unorganized meshes that are equal in shape.
It is at a very early stage of development,lacks most features intended to be added, and still needs fine tuning and testing. But the little that it can do already proves to be somewhat useful in some cases.

# Installation
Just download the source files as a Zip file, and install from within Blender's preferences menu. Enable the addon, and voil√°.

# Supported features (so far)
* Selection of all meshes equal or almost similar in shape to the active selected mesh. It does not matter wether object transforms were applied or not.  
  Limitations of this feature:
  * Right now, this only works if the meshes being compared have **the same vertex ordering** (this tends to be the case), so, keep that in mind. Adding support for point matching will fix this and is the next priority, but it may take some time since it's not a trivial task.
  * Currently, meshes are treated as point clouds, so, meshes that share the same set of vertices, but don't share the same set of polygons will be treated as equal. This, however, is very rare, and should not get in the way of basic selection functionality. It may or may not be changed in the future.
# Usage
Right now, after installing the addon, a menu entry gets added to the 'Select' menu in the 3D view, when in object mode. You can perform the selection via that menu entry, or you can use the default shortcut keyboard SHIFT+E, or set your own in the preferences menu.

After selection, a redo panel is displayed at the bottom left of the 3D Viewport, along with a 'Distance Treshold' property that the user can modify. This treshold  is used to specify the maximum distance that there can be between pairs of corresponding vertices after alignment. Small values might have to be used when working on very small scale scenes (since, say, the default value of 0.001 might actually be a big relative difference at such scales). Bigger values will accept meshes that are less and less equal to the one being compared, and will help with issues with floating point precision (mostly when working at big scales).
